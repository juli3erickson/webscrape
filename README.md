# webscrape
This respository contains 1 file using python, in which I demonstrate my ability to perform a web scraping exercise using the Beautiful Soup library. After 10 years of being a Biotech Scientist, I resigned and am tranisitioning into software engineering.

For this project, I webscraped the title, link, and score of the articles found on the first two pages of Hacker News using the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries. The goal was to determine which articles were the most important and to determine a priority order for reading. It is a tool to help a user prioritize articles for review.
